## Welcome
Welcome to my personal site! I'm Simon Ghyselincks, a PhD-track student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Department of Computer Science. 


## Academics and Projects

I am currently working with [Eldad Haber](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=NZmEIS8AAAAJ&hl=en) from UBC Earth and Ocean Sciences and [Michael Friedlander](https://friedlander.io/) in Computer Science on generative AI and optimization with application to geophysics. My recent work explores the application of advances in normalizing flows with stochastic interpolants to generate 3d models of the earth's crust. My undergraduate two-year senior capstone project is "Learning to Balance" which explores the application of reinforcement learning to a reaction wheel robot with complex dynamics. Read more about my projects [here](/content/projects/projects.qmd).

<!-- ## Looking Forward

I am interested in a Masters or PhD in the field of robotics, computational science and engineering, machine learning, or the intersection of all three!  -->
