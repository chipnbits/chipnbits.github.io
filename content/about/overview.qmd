## Welcome
Welcome to my personal site! I'm Simon Ghyselincks, currently a 5th-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), with a minor in Computer Science. I am studying a cross-disciplinary blend of engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. What I really love is coding to solve tough problems in robotics, machine learning, signal processing, and more.


## Academics and Projects

This summer 2024 I will be working in a reasearch position to develop a GNN for modeling weather patterns and predicting extreme weather events. I am also continuing to develop our Engineering Physics capstone project "Learning to Balance" which explores the application of reinforcement learning to a reaction wheel robot with complex dynamics. Read more about my projects [here](/content/projects/projects.qmd).

<!-- ## Looking Forward

I am interested in a Masters or PhD in the field of robotics, computational science and engineering, machine learning, or the intersection of all three!  -->
