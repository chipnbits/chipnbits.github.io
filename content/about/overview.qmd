## Welcome
Welcome to my personal site! I'm Simon Ghyselincks, a PhD-track student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Department of Computer Science. 


## Academics
I completed my BASc in Engineering Physics with a minor in Computer Science at UBC in 2025. My undergraduate two-year senior capstone project was "Learning to Balance" which explored the application of reinforcement learning to a reaction wheel robot with complex dynamics. Read more about it [here](/content/projects/RLUnicycle/introduction.qmd).

I am currently working with [Eldad Haber](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=NZmEIS8AAAAJ&hl=en) from UBC Earth and Ocean Sciences and [Michael Friedlander](https://friedlander.io/) in Computer Science on generative AI and optimization with applications to geophysics and other fields. You can find out more about my recent publications [here](/content/publications/index.qmd).



<!-- ## Looking Forward

I am interested in a Masters or PhD in the field of robotics, computational science and engineering, machine learning, or the intersection of all three!  -->
