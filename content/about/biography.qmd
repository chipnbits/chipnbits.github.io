I wasn't always so academically focused. In fact, I had a ten year career in forestry where I planted over *2 million* trees along with a variety of other projects. I also spent some years living in the Peruvian Amazon working as a travel guide and translator. 

I came back to study at UBC in 2020 to revisit my interest in science and technology, after an injury required me to change lifestyles. It has been a challenging but rewarding journey, and I am excited to see where it takes me next.
