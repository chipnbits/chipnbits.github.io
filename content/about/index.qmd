Welcome to my personal site! I'm Simon Ghyselincks, currently a 5th-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), with a minor in Computer Science. I am studying a cross-disciplinary blend of engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics. What I really love is coding to solve tough problems in robotics, machine learning, signal processing, and more.


## Academics and Projects

This summer 2024 I will be working in a reasearch position to develop a GNN for modeling weather patterns and predicting extreme weather events. I am also continuing to develop our Engineering Physics capstone project "Learning to Balance" which explores the application of reinforcement learning to a reaction wheel robot with complex dynamics. Read more about my projects [here](/content/projects/projects.qmd).

<!-- ## Looking Forward

I am interested in a Masters or PhD in the field of robotics, computational science and engineering, machine learning, or the intersection of all three!  -->

## Outside the Lab

Feel free to [connect with me on LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/simonghyselincks) or check out my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/chipnbits).

## My Journey

I wasn't always so academically focused. In fact, I had a ten year career in forestry where I planted over *2 million* trees along with a variety of other projects. I also spent some years living in the Peruvian working as a travel guide and translator. 

I came back to study at UBC in 2020 to revisit my interest in science and technology, after an injury required me to change lifestyles. It has been a challenging but rewarding journey, and I am excited to see where it takes me next.
