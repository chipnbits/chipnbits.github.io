The RT kernel is based on the PREEMPT_RT patch, which adds real-time capabilities to the Linux kernel by making it fully preemptible and reducing the latency of the kernel’s interrupt handling.\nThis guide has been modified from some valuable instructions found at: https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/applying-a-preempt-rt-patch-to-jetpack-4-5-on-jetson-nano/168428/4\n\n\nFirst download the BSP from the NVIDIA website. The BSP contains the kernel source code, device tree files, and other necessary files for building the kernel. The BSP also contains the sample root filesystem, which is used to create the final image for the Jetson Nano. You may wish to look up the most recent version of the Tegra for Linux, in this case we are using R32.7.4.\nYou can download all of these files onto a Linux machine specifically running Ubuntu 18.04.

    "text": "2.1 Setting Python Scheduling Privileges\nNote that for this description our team is using Python 3.8 in a virtual environment, the instructions path files may change slightly if using a different version.\nThe scheduling priority is a top-level system command and is usually locked behind ‘sudo’. This is problematic when running a Python script because we don’t want to run it as sudo allowing it full access to wreak havoc on the OS. The solution is to grant only the scheduling part of ‘sudo’ to the Python interpreter:\nThis command only needs to be set once after Python 3.8 is installed (the same in use in our venv): sudo setcap 'cap_sys_nice=eip' /usr/bin/python3.8\n\nsetcap: This is a utility that sets or changes the capabilities of a file/executable. Capabilities are a Linux feature that allow for more fine-grained access control; they provide a way to grant specific privileges to executables that normally only the root user would have.\n'cap_sys_nice=eip': This argument specifies the capabilities to be set on the file, in this case, /usr/bin/python3.8. It’s composed of three parts:\n\ncap_sys_nice: This is the specific capability being set. cap_sys_nice allows the program to raise process nice values (which can deprioritize processes) and change real-time scheduling priorities and policies, without requiring full root privileges.\ne: This stands for “effective” and means the capability is “activated” and can be used by the executable.\ni: This stands for “inheritable”, meaning this capability can be inherited by child processes created by the executable.\np: This stands for “permitted”, which means the capability is allowed for the executable. It’s a part of the set of capabilities that the executable is permitted to use.\n\n/usr/bin/python3.8: This is the path to the Python 3.8 executable. The command sets the specified capabilities on this specific file.",

Thus we model the feedback loop of Controller -&gt; \\(G(s)\\) -&gt; \\(H(s)\\) Sensor Fusion. The sensor fusion and torque request mechanism are modeled as a delay of one \\(100Hz\\) control cycle.\nA PD controller is selected because of the dynamic setpoint that is being controlled by the cascade arrangement. If we were to include an I term then the controller would not be memoryless and would have undesirable response characteristics to the dynamic \\(\\varphi\\) setpoint being requested by the higher level controller. The PD control model is a robust choice for a controller for this robot state parameter, (Brevik 2017).\nThe MATLAB pid tuner is used to get feasible starting values based on this loop.

So we can try to solve the ODE with the SVD.\n\nSolving the ODE with SVD\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA &= U \\Sigma V^\\top\\\\\nA^TA &= V \\Sigma^2 V^\\top\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt}x &= V \\Sigma U^\\top b - V \\Sigma^2 V^\\top x\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow let \\(z = V^\\top x\\) and \\(\\hat b = U ^ \\top b\\) then we have:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dt} (V^\\top x) &= \\Sigma \\hat b - \\Sigma^2 (V^\\top x)\\\\\n\\frac{d}{dt} z &= \\Sigma \\hat b - \\Sigma^2 z\\\\\nz' + \\Sigma^2 z &= \\Sigma \\hat b\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAt this stage since everything has been diagonalized, all of the equations are decoupled and independent so we can solve for the \\(\\lambda_i\\) cases independently. We find the homogeneous \\(z_h\\) and particular \\(z_p\\) solutions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nz_h' + \\lambda^2 z_h &= 0\\\\\nz_h &= c e^{-\\lambda^2 t}\\\\\nz_p' + \\lambda^2 z_p &= \\lambda \\hat b\\\\\nz_p &= D \\hat b \\\\\n\\lambda^2 D \\hat b &= \\lambda \\hat b\\\\\nD &= \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\\\\nz_p &= \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\hat b\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo the general solution for the \\(i^{th}\\) component is:\n\\[z_i = c_i e^{-\\lambda_i^2 t} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} \\hat b_i\\]\nSupposing that we start at \\(x=0\\) then we have \\(z=0\\) at all elements and can solve the coefficients \\(c_i\\):\n\\[c_i = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} \\hat b_i\\]\nThen putting it all back together with all the equations we have that\n\\[Z = \\text{diag}\\left( \\lambda_i^{-1} (1 - \\exp (-\\lambda_i t)) \\right) \\hat b\\]\nSubstituting back in for \\(x\\) and \\(b\\) we get:\n\\[x = V \\text{diag}\\left( \\lambda_i^{-1} (1 - \\exp (-\\lambda_i t)) \\right) U^\\top b\\]\nIf we stare at this long enough it begins to look a lot like the pseudoinverse of \\(A\\) from earlier:\n\\(x = V \\Sigma^{-1} U^\\top b\\) except in this case there is a time dependence. At the limit as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\) we have that the exponential term goes to zero and we are left with the pseudoinverse solution. This is a nice way to see that the pseudoinverse is the limit of the gradient descent algorithm. What we may be interested in is what happens at earlier stages since each decay term is dependent on the eigenvalues.\nFor a simple matrix problem we can create a matrix and plot out the time evolution of the diagonals of the matrix that are of interest. In a sense, we have singular values that are time evolving at different rates.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(4)\n# Create a 5x10 matrix A with random values\nA = np.random.randn(5, 10)\n# Create a vector b of size 5 with random values\nb = np.random.randn(5)\n\n# Compute the SVD of A\nU, S, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=False)\n\n# Create a time dependent vector of the singular values\ndef St(t):\n    Sdim = S[:, np.newaxis]\n    return (1 - np.exp(-Sdim**2*t)) / Sdim\n\n# Compute the time evolution of the values and plot them on a log scale y axis with a linear time x axis\nt = np.linspace(0, .6, 100)\nT = t[np.newaxis, :]\n\nsingular_vals_t = St(T)\n\n# Initialize the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Create a color palette\npalette = sns.color_palette(\"husl\", len(S))\n\n# Plot the singular values and their asymptotes\nfor i in range(len(S)):\n    # Plot the time evolution of each singular value\n    sns.lineplot(x=t, y=singular_vals_t[i, :], color=palette[i], linewidth=2, label=f'$1/S_{i}$ ')\n    \n    Sinv = 1/S[i]\n\n    # Add a horizontal asymptote at the original singular value\n    plt.axhline(y=Sinv, color=palette[i], linestyle='--', linewidth=1)\n    \n    # Annotate the asymptote with the singular value\n    plt.text(t[-1] + 0.02, Sinv, f'{Sinv:.2f}', color=palette[i], va='center')\n\n# Configure plot aesthetics\nplt.xlabel('Time', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel('Inverse Singular Vals', fontsize=14)\nplt.title('Time Evolution of Pseudo Inverse in Gradient Flow', fontsize=16)\nplt.legend(title='Inverse Singular Vals', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\nplt.xlim(t[0], t[-1] + 0.1)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig('imgs/pseudo_inverse_time_evolution.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we can use early stopping to prevent the flow from reaching the optimal point, a very useful technique. When it comes to inverse theory, often we are not interested in the optimal solution, but more interested in getting somewhere close that is not too noisy. This method differs from the thresholded pseudoinverse from the previous lecture, in that it allows some blending of the the smaller singular values, but their propensity for blowing up is controlled by the time exponent and early stopping.\n\n\nExample for Image Recovery using Analytic Solution\nReferring back to the problem of estimating the original image based on a noisy point spread function. We can monitor the time evolution of the estimate using gradient flow. Some code below defines the problem again, with recovery of the SVD decomposition for the 32x32 image, which will be used to solve the ODE for the gradient flow.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\n#matplotlib.use('TkAgg')\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch.optim\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.optim import Adam\nimport copy\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport math\nimport os\nimport time\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch.fft\n\nclass gaussianConv(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    A PyTorch module that applies a Gaussian convolution to an input image using \n    a parameterized Gaussian Point Spread Function (PSF).

    "text": "Recovery of the Adjoint Operator using Autograd\nIn this case we were able to compute the matrix form of \\(A\\) and use its transpose to compute the SVD, but in many cases this might be too expensive or there may not be a closed form analytic solution to the early stopping technique. In such cases we wish to recover the adjoint. The question then is how to recover the adjoint operator from the Amv operator? There are helpful tools available through the use of automatic differentiation to track the gradients of the forward operator and recover the adjoint operator. This is a very powerful tool that can be used to recover the adjoint operator in a very general way.\nBy definition the adjoint has the property that: \\[\\langle Ax, v \\rangle = \\langle x, A^\\top v \\rangle\\]\n\nExplicit Computation of the Adjoint\nWe can compute the adjoint explicitly for the Amv operator based on its computation from earlier. The discrete fourier transform matrix operator \\(F\\) has the property that \\(F^{-1} = F^\\top\\) so we can use this to compute the adjoint.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA(x) &= \\mathcal{F}^-1 \\left( \\mathcal{F}(P) \\odot \\mathcal{F}(x) \\right)\\\\\n&= F^\\top \\left( \\text{diag} (F(P)) F(x) \\right)\\\\\nA^\\top(v) &= F^\\top \\text{diag} (F(P))^* F v\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhere the hadamard operation of the two vectors has been modified to a matrix form by diagonalizing the vector \\(F(P)\\) that is the Fourier transform of the point spread function. From this form it is posible to take the adjoint of the operator by taking the complex conjugate of the transpose of the entire operation.\n\n\nAutograd Computation of the Adjoint\nWe start with a new function \\(h = v^\\top A(x)\\) and we wish to compute the gradient of \\(h\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\n\\[ \\nabla_x h = \\nabla_x (v^\\top A(x)) = A^\\top(v)\\]\nThe gradient of \\(h\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is the adjoint operator \\(A^\\top(v)\\). We can use the torch.autograd.grad function to compute the gradient of \\(h\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\n\n\nShow the code\ndef Amv_adjoint(v):\n    x = torch.zeros(1, 1, dim, dim)\n    x.requires_grad = True\n    b = Amv(x)\n    # Compute the dot product of the forward operator with the input vector\n    h = torch.sum(b * v)\n    # Compute the gradient of the dot product with respect to the input image\n    adjoint = torch.autograd.grad(h, x, create_graph=True)[0]\n    return adjoint\n\n\nWe can use this to recover \\(A^\\top\\) for the general case if we run the operator on the set of basis vectors in the image space. This will give us the adjoint operator in the form of a matrix. We can also use it to confirm that it recovers the matrix transpose of the forward operator if we are working with a simple matrix, reusing the Amat matrix from earlier to take its transpose and compare it to the adjoint operator.\n\n\nShow the code\nAmat_adj = torch.zeros(n,n)\n\ndim = 32 # Same as earlier\nk=0\nfor i in range(dim):\n  for j in range(dim):\n    e_ij = torch.zeros_like(x)\n    e_ij[:,:, i, j] = 1.0\n    y = Amv_adjoint(e_ij)\n    Amat_adj[:, k] = y.flatten()\n    k = k+1\n\ndiff = torch.norm(Amat_adj - Amat.T)\nprint(f'Norm of difference between adjoint and transpose: {diff:.2e}')\n\n\nNorm of difference between adjoint and transpose: 4.43e-07\n\n\nSo the difference is within the bounds of numerical precison and the code appears to be working correctly."

autograd on the least squares objective itself, but for this general method we are using the adjoint to compute the gradient (and indirectly invoking autograd). This framework is the most general for when there might not be explicit analytic solutions to the least squares problem, but we have the forward operator and its adjoint."

    "title": "Lecture 1: Introduction to Inverse Theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Inverse theory is a set of mathematical techniques used to infer the properties of a physical system from observations of its output. It is a fundamental tool in many scientific disciplines, including geophysics, seismology, and medical imaging. Inverse theory is used to solve a wide range of problems, such as:\n\nParameter Estimation: Determining the values of unknown parameters in a model that best fit the observed data.\nSystem Identification: Identifying the structure and dynamics of a system from input-output data.\nImage Reconstruction: Reconstructing an image or object from noisy or incomplete measurements.\n\nWhat many of these tasks have in common is that we are working with incomplete information. There is a forward problem that has generated the data that we observe \\(\\vec{b}\\) from a set of input data \\(\\vec{x}\\), and we want to infer the inverse problem that generated the data. However the inverse problem is often ill-posed, meaning that there are multiple solutions that can fit the data equally well. Inverse theory provides a framework for finding the best solution to these problems.\nThe forward problem can be described for example as a differetial equation or operator \\(L\\) that takes in some measured parameters \\(u\\) with model parameters \\(x\\) :\n\\[ L(x)[u] = q \\iff u = L^{-1}(x)[q] \\]\nFor example making measurements of an electromagnetic field in correspondence to conductivity values that are underground we have:\n\\[ \\nabla \\sigma \\nabla u = q + \\text{BC}\\]\nWe measure the \\(u\\) at some points and use that to try and form an estimate of the conductivity \\(\\sigma\\). The forward problem is to solve for \\(u\\) given \\(\\sigma\\) and the inverse problem is to solve for \\(\\sigma\\) given \\(u\\). The forward problem is often well-posed and the inverse problem is often ill-posed.\nFor a computational framework we can discretize the the equation so that the operator is a matrix \\(A\\) and the data is a vector \\(\\vec{b}\\):\n\\[ \\underbrace{A}_{\\text{Forward Map}} \\underbrace{\\vec{x}}_{\\text{Model Parameters}} + \\epsilon = \\underbrace{\\vec{b}}_{\\text{Observed Data}} \\]\nIn this case we may have a sparse set of measurements \\(b\\) and a large set of \\(x\\) making the problem underdetermined. The goal of inverse theory is to find the best estimate of \\(x\\) given \\(b\\).\n\n\nTo illustrate the concept of inverse theory, consider the following example:\n\nSuppose that you have agreed to meet a friend to watch them during a triathlon race but you showed up late and missed the start. They are expecting for you to have been there at some point during the time at which they were changing from a running phase to a cycle phase. They expect you to know the time at which they made the transition. However you only know the overall start time and finish time of the race.\nIf the race starts at time \\(t=0\\) and then ends at time \\(t=b\\) how do you use this information to deduce the actual time \\(t_r \\in [0,b]\\) at which they crossed the transition zone of the race?\n\nThe first restriction on feasible solutions is the domain \\([0,b]\\) so that we know that \\(0&lt;t_r&lt;b\\).\nAfter this there are some other techniquest that we could use to better inform the probability of the occurence at different times. For example, we might have a good idea of their fitness level or average running speed from previous experience. Or in the abscence of this information there might be average times for the competitors that are available to further inform the problem and reduce the amount of error in the estimate.\n\n\n\nFor cases where the matrix \\(A\\) is not full rank, the singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a more general framework for solving the least squares problem. The SVD decomposes the matrix \\(A\\) into three matrices \\(U\\), \\(\\Sigma\\), and \\(V\\)\n\\[ A = U \\Sigma V^T \\]\nThe matrices have the following special properties:\n\nOrthogonal Subspaces: \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are orthogonal matrices, meaning that \\(U^TU = I\\) and \\(V^TV = I\\), that is \\(U^T = U^{-1}\\) and $V^T = V^{-1}.\nOrdered Singular Values: \\(\\Sigma\\) is a diagonal matrix with non-negative values on the diagonal, known as the singular values of \\(A\\). The singular values are ordered such that \\(\\sigma_1 \\geq \\sigma_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq \\sigma_r\\). The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of \\(A\\).\n\nSupposed that we have a \\(\\text{rank}(A) = r\\) matrix \\(A\\) which maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n\\). A fundamental way to view this mapping is as a composition of three linear transformations: a rotation \\(V\\), a scaling \\(\\Sigma\\), and another rotation \\(U\\). The orthogonal matrix \\(V\\) has the property that all of its rows and columns are orthogonal to each other, and the vectors themselves are normalized to \\(1\\). To see this property of the orthogonal matrix consider that \\(V^T V = I\\) and \\(V V^T = I\\):\n\\[ \\begin{align}\nZ = V^T V &= I \\\\\nz_{ij} = \\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle &= \\delta_{ij} \\end{align} \\]\nEach of the elements of the matrix \\(V^T\\) is the dot product of the \\(i\\)th and \\(j\\)th columns of \\(V\\). The dotproduct of all vectors against themselves is \\(1\\) and the dotproduct of any two different vectors is \\(0\\). So from this we can see that all of the columns of \\(V\\) are orthogonal to each other. The same property holds for \\(U\\).\n\\(V^T\\) by our definition of \\(A\\) must accept a vector from \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) and the matrix is square, indicating an \\(m \\times m\\) matrix. The matrix \\(U\\) must output a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and the matrix is square, indicating an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. The matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) must be \\(n \\times m\\) to map from \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\).\nIn all its glory:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{n \\times m} &= U_{n \\times n} \\, \\Sigma_{n \\times m} \\, V^T_{m \\times m} \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}\n\\mathbf{u}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{u}_r & \\mathbf{u}_{r+1} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{u}_n\n\\end{array} \\right]_{n \\times n}\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\sigma_1 &  &  \\\\\n& \\ddots &  \\\\\n&  & \\sigma_r \\\\\n0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\cdots & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]_{n \\times m}\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}\n\\mathbf{v}^T_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}^T_r \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}^T_{r+1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n  \\mathbf{v}^T_m\n\\end{array} \\right]_{m \\times m}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this case the first \\(r\\) columns of \\(U\\) are the range of \\(A\\), the rest of \\(U\\) is filled with its orthogonal complement. The first \\(r\\) columns of \\(V\\) are the domain of \\(A\\), the rest of \\(V\\) is filled with its orthogonal complement. These are the four fundamental subspaces of the matrix \\(A\\), more information on this can be found at: Wikipedia: SVD\nThe matrices as shown above are for a rectangular \\(A\\) where \\(n&gt;m\\) but the same properties hold for all \\(n,m\\). Some of the singular values \\(\\sigma_i\\) may be zero, in which case the matrix \\(A\\) is not full rank.\nAnother way to decompose the SVD is to write it as a sum of outer products that are scaled by the diagonal matrix of singular values:\n\\[ A = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\sigma_i \\mathbf{u}_i \\mathbf{v}_i^T \\]\nIf \\(\\sigma_i&gt;0\\) then \\(v_i\\) is not in the null space of \\(A\\) because \\(A v_i = \\sigma_i u_i\\). If \\(\\sigma_i = 0\\) then \\(v_i\\) is in the null space of \\(A\\) because \\(A v_i = 0\\).\n\n\nBack to the task of inverting \\(Ax + \\epsilon = b\\) we can apply the SVD decomposition:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nU \\Sigma V^T x + \\epsilon &= b \\\\\n\\Sigma V^T x +&= U^T (b-\\epsilon) \\\\\nV \\Sigma^{-1} U^T (b-\\epsilon) &= x\\\\\nA^+ (b-\\epsilon) &= \\hat{x}\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhere \\(A^+ = V \\Sigma^{-1} U^T\\) is the pseudoinverse of \\(A\\). The pseudoinverse is a generalization of the matrix inverse for non-square matrices. We recover a square matrix by removing all of the absent or zero singular values from \\(\\Sigma\\) and inverting the rest, giving an \\(r \\times r\\) diagonal matrix whose inverse is simply the inverse of each element.\n\\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\sigma_1 &  &  \\\\\n& \\ddots &  \\\\\n&  & \\sigma_r \\\\\n0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\cdots & 0\n\\end{array} \\right]_{n \\times m}\n\\rightarrow \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\sigma_1^{-1} &  &  \\\\\n  & \\ddots &  \\\\\n  &  & \\sigma_r^{-1} \\\\\n  \\end{array} \\right]_{r \\times r}\\]\nThen \\[\\hat{x} = \\sum_i^N \\sigma_i^{-1} \\mathbf{u}_i^T (b-\\epsilon) \\mathbf{v}_i\\] is the solution to the least squares problem. This can be solved also as a truncated sum since \\(0&lt;N&lt;r\\). In actual practice with real world measurement we end up with many singular values that may be effectively \\(0\\) by nature of being very small relative to the noise in the data and the largest single value. We have that the solution \\(\\hat{x}\\) is a sum of \\(v_i\\) components that form an orthogonal basis \\(\\hat{x} = \\sum_i \\beta_i v_i\\) where \\(\\beta_i = \\frac{u_i^T (b-\\epsilon)}{\\sigma_i}\\). These small singular values blow up in size when inverted and so extra truncation is often necessary to avoid numerical instability and excessive amplification of noise \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nLeast squares and matrix inversion is a classic starting point for understanding inverse theory. Suppose that we have input data \\(\\vec{x}\\) and output data \\(\\vec{b}\\) that are related by a linear system of equations: \\[Ax = b\\] where \\(A\\) is a matrix of coefficients. In many cases, the system is overdetermined, meaning that there are more equations than unknowns. In this case, there is no exact solution to the system, and we must find the best solution that minimizes the error between the observed data \\(\\vec{b}\\) and the predicted data \\(A\\vec{x}\\). In the simplest form of inversion that we can attempt, we can solve the least squares solution. In this case we reject all of the observed data that is from the null space of \\(A\\) assuming a zero value for each of those parameters.\n\n\nLet \\(A\\) be a \\(3 \\times 2\\) matrix and \\(\\vec{b}\\) be a \\(3 \\times 1\\) vector. The \\(\\vec{x}\\) that we are trying to solve for is a \\(2 \\times 1\\) vector. The system of equations is given by:\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix}  \\vec{a}_1 & \\vec{a}_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2  \\end{bmatrix}  \\quad \\vec{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nIn this case we have an overdetermined system with three equations, two unknowns, and three data samples. If the system of equations is full rank then we are trying to map from a 2D space to a 3D space: \\(A: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\). In this case there is no exact solution to the system for any \\(b\\) that is not in the column space of \\(A\\).\nInstead we can solve for the least squares solution \\(\\vec{x}_{LS}\\) by minimizing the error between the observed data \\(\\vec{b}\\) and the predicted data \\(A\\vec{x}\\) from the forward model.\n\\[ \\vec{x}_{LS} = \\arg \\min_{\\vec{x}} ||A\\vec{x} - \\vec{b}||_2^2 \\]\nWe want to find the argument that minimizes the function \\(f(\\vec{x}) = ||A\\vec{x} - \\vec{b}||_2^2\\).

We take a note of caution here that \\(A^T A\\) must be invertible for this solution to exist. If \\(A\\) is not full rank then the matrix \\(A^T A\\) will not be invertible and other methods must be used.\nWe call the difference between the observed data and the predicted data the residual.\n\\(r = \\vec{b} - A\\vec{x}_{LS}\\)\nUsing this information, what we really want to minimize is the sum of the squares of the residuals: \\(||r||_2^2\\). This is the same as the sum of the squares of the errors in the data.\nThere is an altogether informative way to think about the minimization problem purely in terms of linear algebra and subspaces to derive the same normal equations.\n\n\n\nLeast Squares Visual\n\n\nWe have the range of \\(A\\) or image of \\(A\\) as the subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) that is spanned by the columns of \\(A\\). This subspace is rank \\(2\\) because there are only two columns in \\(A\\), \\(R(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\). The inaccessible parts of \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) are in the orthogonal complement of \\(R(A)\\), \\(R(A)^\\perp\\). Recalling that \\(R(A)^\\perp = N(A^T)\\) we can diagram the solution to least squares as a minimization of the error vector \\(r\\) in the orthogonal complement of \\(R(A)\\).\nAs seen the \\(r\\) vector is perpendicular to the \\(x_{LS}\\) solution, the projection of \\(r\\) onto \\(R(A)\\) is zero. Since it is in a null space of \\(A^T\\) then \\(A^T r = 0\\).\n\\[ \\begin{align} A^T \\left ( Ax_{LS} - b \\right ) &= 0\\\\\nA^T A x_{LS} &= A^T b \\\\\n\\end {align} \\]\nSo we recover the normal equations without using any of the machinery of calculus.\nFor a review on the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix see the UBC Math 307 notes on the topic: Math 307"

The singular values are ordered such that \\(\\sigma_1 \\geq \\sigma_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq \\sigma_r\\). The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of \\(A\\).\n\nSupposed that we have a \\(\\text{rank}(A) = r\\) matrix \\(A\\) which maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n\\). A fundamental way to view this mapping is as a composition of three linear transformations: a rotation \\(V\\), a scaling \\(\\Sigma\\), and another rotation \\(U\\). The orthogonal matrix \\(V\\) has the property that all of its rows and columns are orthogonal to each other, and the vectors themselves are normalized to \\(1\\). To see this property of the orthogonal matrix consider that \\(V^T V = I\\) and \\(V V^T = I\\):\n\\[ \\begin{align}\nZ = V^T V &= I \\\\\nz_{ij} = \\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle &= \\delta_{ij} \\end{align} \\]\nEach of the elements of the matrix \\(V^T\\) is the dot product of the \\(i\\)th and \\(j\\)th columns of \\(V\\). The dotproduct of all vectors against themselves is \\(1\\) and the dotproduct of any two different vectors is \\(0\\). So from this we can see that all of the columns of \\(V\\) are orthogonal to each other.

    "text": "The Problem of Density Estimation\nWhen working with a set of data, one of the tasks that we often want to do is to estimate the underlying probability density function (PDF) of the data. Knowing the probability distribution is a powerful tool that allows to make predictions, generate new samples, and understand the data better. For example, we may have a coin and want to know the probability of getting heads or tails. We can flip the coin many times and count the number of heads and tails to estimate the probability of each outcome. However, when it comes to higher dimensional spaces that are continuous in distribution, the problem of estimating the PDF in this way becomes intractable.\nFor example, with a set of small images such as the CIFAR-10 dataset, the images are 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels. The number of dimensions in the data space is 32x32x3 = 3072. With 8-bit images the number of all possible unique images is \\(255^{3072}\\), which is an incomprehensibly large number. The 60,000 images that are included in CIFAR-10 represent but a tiny fraction of samples in the space of all possible images.\n Figure 1: Sample images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (Krizhevsky 2009)\nTo demonstrate the issue with random image generation in such a sparsely populated space, we can generate a random 32x32 image with 3 color channels and display it.\n\n\nShow the code\nusing Plots, Images\n\n# Generate 6 random images and display them in a grid\nplots = []\nfor i in 1:6\n    # Generate a random 32x32 3-channel image\n    im = rand(3, 32, 32)\n    im = colorview(RGB, im)\n    p = plot(im, showaxis=false, showgrid=false, title=\"Random Image $i\")\n    push!(plots, p)\nend\n\n# Create a plot with a 2x3 grid layout\nplot_grid = plot(plots..., layout=(2, 3), size=(800, 400))\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes we have successfuly generated random 32x32 color images, but they are not very useful or interesting.\nIf there were some way to learn the underlying distribution of the data, we could generate new samples that are realistic (probable) but that have never been seen before by sampling from higher probability regions of the learned distribution. So how do recent developments in machine learning manage to generate new and plausible samples from high dimensional data sets?\nOne of the techniques that has been developed is called generative modeling. Generative models are a class of machine learning models that are trained to learn the underlying distribution of the data. Once the model has learned the distribution, it can generate new samples that are similar to the training data.\nOne of the powerful techniques that allows for learning a probability distribution is score matching.\n\n\nParameter Estimation\nLet us take a moment to consider the problem of fitting a model to data in the most simple sense. Suppose that we have a set of data points and want to fit a linear model by drawing a line through it. One of the techniques that can be used is to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the data points and the line. This is known as the method of least squares.\nWe have model \\(f(x) = \\hat y = mx + b\\) with free parameters \\(\\theta = {m, b}\\) and data points \\((x_i, y_i)\\). The objective is to find the parameters \\(\\theta\\) that minimize the sum of the squared errors \\(J\\) between the predicted values \\(\\hat y_i\\) and the true values \\(y_i\\).: \\[  \\text{arg}\\min_{m,b} J(m,b) = \\text{arg}\\min_{m,b} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat y_i - y_i)^2 \\]\nWe could use some calculus at this point to solve the minimization problem but more general matrix methods can be used to solve the problem.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    X &= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 \\\\ 1 & x_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{bmatrix} , \\quad  \\vec{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{bmatrix} , \\quad \\vec{\\theta} &= \\begin{bmatrix} b \\\\ m \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n    \\text{arg}\\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} J(\\vec{\\theta}) &= \\text{arg}\\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} ||\\vec{\\hat y} - \\vec{y}||^2\\\\\n    \\text{arg}\\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} J(\\vec{\\theta}) &= \\text{arg}\\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} ||X\\vec{\\theta} - \\vec{y}||^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe solution to this problem is well known and can be found by solving the normal equations: \\[ X^T X \\vec{\\theta} = X^T \\vec{y} \\]\nAn example of this optimization problem is shown below where we generate some random data points and fit a line to them.\n\n\nShow the code\nusing Plots, Random\n\n# Generate some random data points with correlation along a line\nRandom.seed!(1234)\nn_points = 10\nx = rand(n_points)\nm_true = 0.8; b_true = -1\ny = .8* x .- 1 + 0.3 * randn(n_points)\n\n# Create the matrix X\nX = hcat(ones(n_points), x)\n\n# Solve the normal equations to find the parameters theta\ntheta = X \\ y\n\n# Generate x values for the complete line\nx_line = range(minimum(x) - 0.1, maximum(x) + 0.1, length=100)\nX_line = hcat(ones(length(x_line)), x_line)\n\n# Compute the y values for the line\ny_hat_line = X_line * theta\n\n# Compute the fitted values for the original data points\ny_hat = X * theta\n\n# Unpack learned parameters\nb, m = theta\n\n# Plot the data points and the fitted line\ntitle_text = \"Fitted Line: y = $(round(m, digits=2))x + $(round(b, digits=2)) vs. \\n True Line: y = $(m_true)x + $(b_true)\"\np1 = scatter(x, y, label=\"Data Points\", color=:red, ms=5, aspect_ratio=:equal, xlabel=\"x\", ylabel=\"y\", title=title_text)\nplot!(p1, x_line, y_hat_line, label=\"Fitted Line\", color=:blue)\n# Add dashed lines for residuals\nfor i in 1:n_points\n    plot!(p1, [x[i], x[i]], [y[i], y_hat[i]], color=:black, linestyle=:dash, label=\"\")\nend\n\ndisplay(p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple example of parameter estimation but it shows some of the important concepts that are used in more complex models. There is an underlying distribution which is a line with some error or noise added to it. We collected some random points from the distribution and then used them in an optimization problem where we minimized the squared error between the predicted values and the true values. The best solution is the parameters \\(\\theta\\) that minimize the error. In doing so we recovered a line that is close to the one that was used to generate the data.\n\n\nEstimating a Density Function\nWhen it comes to estimating denstity we are constrained by the fact that any model must sum to 1 of the entire sample space.\n\n\nDenoising Autoencoders\nDenoising Autoencoders (DAE) are a type of machine learning model that is trained to reconstruct the input data from a noisy or corrupted version of the input. The DAE is trained to take an sample such as an image with unwanted noise and restore it to the original sample.\nIn the process of learning the denoising parameters, the DAE also can learn the score function the underlying distribution of noisy samples, which is a kernel density estimate of the true distribution.\nThe score function is an operator defined as: \\[ s(f(x)) = \\nabla_x \\log f(x) \\]\nWhere \\(f(x)\\) is the density function or PDF of the distribution.\nBy learning a score function for a model, we can reverse the score operation to obtain the original density function it was derived from. This is the idea behind score matching, where we indirectly find the the pdf of a distribution by matching the score of a proposed model \\(p(x;\\theta)\\) to the score of the true distribution \\(q(x)\\).\nAnother benefit of learning the score function of a distribution is that it can be used to move from less probable regions of the distribution to more probable regions using gradient ascent. This is useful when it comes to generative models, where we want to generate new samples from the distribution that are more probable.\nHowever one of the challenges is that the score function is not always well-defined, especially in regions of low probability where there are sparse samples. This can make it difficult to learn the score function accurately in these regions.\nThis post explores some of those limitations and how increasing the bandwidth of the noise kernel in the DAE can help to stabilize the score function in regions of low probability.\n\n\nSample of Score Matching\nSuppose we have a distribution in 2D space that consists of three Gaussians as our ground truth.

The score function of the distribution is numerically unstable at regions of sparse data. Recalling that the score is the gradient of the log-density funtion, when the density is very low the function approaches negative infinity. Within the limits of numerical precision, taking the log of the density function will result in a negative infinity in sparse and low probability regions. Higher bandwidths of KDE using the Gaussian kernel for example, spread out both the discrete sampling and the true distribution over space. This extends the region of numerical stability for a higher bandwidth.\nThe regions with poor numerical stability can be seen as noise artifacts and missing data in the partial derivatives of the log-density function.

Michael Friedlander, who teaches CPSC 406 Computational Optimization at UBC, is an advocate for using Julia and Quarto in teaching and research. Drawing inspiration from his work along with Patrick Altmeyer’s website, I have decided to start my own blog using Quarto.\nQuarto is a scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It is designed to make it easy to write and publish technical content, such as research papers, books, and reports. One of its main features is that it allows for writing content in markdown along with code chunks in Julia, Python, R, and other languages. In addition, Quarto supports a wide range of output formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word. It has the great convenience of being able to port writing from Obsidian or in Latex to a blog post or html with minimal effort.\nI’m excited to use this new tool to share my work and ideas, especially as I continue to learn more about data science, machine learning, and optimization. I hope you find the content here useful and/or interesting."

    "text": "The motivation for the exercise comes from a real world problem. The Hubble space telescope when launched had a defect in its mirror. This defect caused the images to be blurred. The problem was initially addressed by using signal processing techniques to remove the aberrations from the images.\n\n\nFor such an image processing problem, we can consider the continuous incoming light as striking a 2D mirror that distorts the light, followed by a 2D sensor that captures the light. In this context we suppose that we have a noise kernel or a point spread function (PSF) that describes the distortion of the light at the mirror. The point spread function, being a convolution kernel, behaves as a Green’s function for the system in the continuous case:\n\\[ \\vec{b}(x,y) = \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}} \\vec{G}(x - x', y - y') \\vec{u}(x',y') \\, dx' dy' \\]\nwhere \\(\\vec{b}(x,y)\\) is the blurred image data that is recovered at the sensor, \\(\\vec{u}(x',y')\\) is the true image data, and \\(\\vec{G}(x,y)\\) is the point spread function.\nIn the special case that the point spread function is \\(\\delta(x-x',y-y')\\), then the image data is not distorted and the sensor captures the true image data. However our experiment is to consider cases where there could be even severe distortions and see how this impacts the proposition of recovering the true image data, \\(\\vec{u}(x',y')\\) from our sensor data, \\(\\vec{b}(x,y)\\).\n\n\nThe discrete analog of the continuous PSF can be more conveniently treated with we essentially flatten the the 2D mesh into a 1D vector, a common operation for signal processing. The unflattened case we have:\n\\[ b_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sum_{l=1}^{m} \\Delta x \\Delta y G(x_i - x_k, y_j - y_l) u_{kl} \\]\nwhere \\(b\\) is the blurred image data at the sensor, \\(u\\) is the true image data, and \\(G\\) is the discrete point spread function. If we flatten the 2D mesh into a 1D vector we can represent this as a 1D convolution operation: \\[ \\vec{b} = \\vec{G} * \\vec{u} \\]\nSince this is a convolution operation, we can process it much more quickly by leveraging the convolution theorem.\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{F}(\\vec{b}) &= \\mathcal{F}(\\vec{G} * \\vec{u}) \\\\\n\\mathcal{F}(\\vec{b}) &= \\mathcal{F}(\\vec{G}) \\mathcal{F}(\\vec{u}) \\\\\n\\vec{b} &= \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathcal{F}(\\vec{G}) \\odot \\mathcal{F}(\\vec{u}))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe \\(\\odot\\) hadamard product is element-wise multiplication, the discrete analog of multiplication of two functions except over an array.\n\n\n\n\nIf we flatten the data down into a 1D vector then it is possible to construct a matrix operator that performs the convolution. This is a Toeplitz matrix, a matrix where each descending diagonal from left to right is constant, so that the row vectors represent a sliding window of the convolution kernel. We can flatten out the PSF and construct the matrix using it as the first row entry and then shifting the PSF to the right to fill out the rest of the rows."

To get an idea of what the values are doing, we can plot the first few singular values and the corresponding singular vector that they project onto.

We can also check what the right-most vectors are doing, as they will blow up in value when inverting small singular values.

We can try the pseudoinverse method again with the noise added to the signal.\n\n\nShow the code\nAmat_noisy = Amat + alpha * torch.eye(Amat.shape[0])\nUn, Sn, Vn = torch.svd(Amat_noisy)\n\nthresholds = [.5, .1, .05, .03, .005, .001]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(7,5))  # Adjust the figure size as needed\n\nfor idx, threshold in enumerate(thresholds):\n    # Filter the singular values\n    S_filtered = Sn.clone()\n    S_filtered[S_filtered &lt; threshold] = 0\n\n    # Compute the reciprocal of the filtered singular values\n    S_inv = torch.zeros_like(S_filtered)\n    non_zero_mask = S_filtered &gt; 0\n    S_inv[non_zero_mask] = 1 / S_filtered[non_zero_mask]\n\n    # Construct the pseudoinverse of Amat\n    A_pinv = Vn @ torch.diag(S_inv) @ Un.T\n\n    # Reconstruct the original image\n    xhat = A_pinv @ (b_flat + noise)\n\n    # Compute the reconstruction error\n    error = torch.norm(xhat - x_flat, p='fro').item()\n\n    # Plot the reconstructed image in the appropriate subplot\n    plt.subplot(2, 3, idx + 1)  # idx + 1 because subplot indices start at 1\n    plt.imshow(xhat.reshape(x.shape[-2:]))\n    plt.title(f'Threshold {threshold}\\nError: {error:.4f}')\n    plt.colorbar()\n    plt.axis('off')  # Optionally turn off axis ticks and labels\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudoinverse Recovery of the Original Image with Noise.\n\n\n\n\nThe small addition of noise is quite significant in the recovery threshold for reconstruction. Using a higher threshold for the singular values becomes important when dealing with noise in the signal. Previously numerical precision was the main issue, but now the measurement noise is the main issue."

It has a total height of 30cm and a weight of 1.25kg, incorporating a compact and efficient design intended to allow self-erection from a position resting on its resetting legs. The Jetson Nano acts as an autonomous controller that reads the sensors and reacts to the environment using the motors.\n\nMuch like a unicycle, it balances on one wheel, with side-to-side stability provided by the roll wheel and direction controlled by a yaw wheel. The mechanism of balancing and steering relies on a reaction torque produced by spinning the reaction wheels. When a motor applies torque to one of the flywheels, an equal and opposite torque acts on the robot’s body, with the net effect altering the angular motion of both the wheel and the robot. The unstable axes to control are roll and pitch where the robot will fall to the ground without any intervention.\n\n\n\n\nSide View Pitch Axis\n\n\n\n\n\nSide View Roll Axis",

    "section": "2.2 MQTT Overview",
    "text": "2.2 MQTT Overview\nThe robot an network is using the MQTT protocol to implement live telemetry. Topics are used on a subscriber publisher basis. All communication is routed through the Lenovo server that is acting as the broker. The Mosquitto MQTT server software is running on the Lenovo server which is the IP address used for routing messages. The default port for MQTT is 1883.\n# Define the MQTT settings\nbroker_address = \"172.22.1.1\" #Lenovo's IP address\nport = 1883\ntopic = \"robot/telemetry\"\nThe MQTT explorer offers comprehensive tools to explore available topics and more: https://mqtt-explorer.com/ This can be a very useful tool for debugging and exploring the MQTT network to check if messages are being sent and received.\nMQTT interfaces with Python, Node-Red, and Grafana to provide a comprehensive data pipeline. The MQTT broker is the central hub for all data that is being sent and received. The broker can be accessed by any device on the ZeroTier network that is subscribed to the topic.\n\n2.2.1 MQTT Summary\nMQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that provides an efficient and cost-effective method of carrying out telemetry-based communication between devices. It’s especially popular in Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to its minimal bandwidth requirements and ease of implementation on hardware with limited processing capabilities.\n\n2.2.1.1 Key Features of MQTT:\n\nLightweight Protocol: Ideal for constrained devices and networks with limited bandwidth.\nPublish-Subscribe Model: Allows devices to publish messages to a topic and any client subscribed to that topic will receive the messages.\nReliable Message Delivery: Offers various levels of Quality of Service (QoS) to guarantee message delivery.\nMinimal Overhead: Adds only a small overhead to each message, ensuring efficient use of network resources.\nRetained Messages: Supports retaining the last message sent on a topic, making it available immediately to new subscribers.\nLast Will and Testament: Provides a means for a client to notify other clients about an abnormal disconnection.\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Application for our Robot\nThe Lenovo acts as a broker for all the data that is streaming out of the robot over a Wi-Fi connection to the internet. This offloads the databasing and broadcasting duty from the robot to the broker which can dedicate more resources to data management. The robot can publish data to a topic, which can be picked up by various subscribers such as the Lenovo’s Grafana server or other laptops, phones, etc that are connected to the broker and subscribed to the topic.\nMore Detailed System Diagram needed \nThe broker can duplicate the published data to many devices in real-time. Another hidden stream for the data is through Node-Red to InfluxDB where the aggregate data can be store more permanently for access to testing records at a later date. Additionally, an MQTT bridge is connected to the Pi’s Grafana server which offers an advanced dashboard service for viewing live telemetry. Note that databased telemetry can also be viewed through Grafana which is connected to InfluDB, but it is a seperate data stream from MQTT and should have a seperate dashboard.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Publishing Messages\nA sample script for publishing messages with Paho-MQTT client Documentation to the Lenovo server/broker while connected to Zero-Tier is provided, see the mqtt.py file. The script allows for publishing a controller value or a cpu_usage data point.\nPrerequisites\n\nMQTT Broker Setup: Ensure that the MQTT broker, in this case, the Lenovo server, is up and running.\nNetwork Connection: Connect your device to the Zero-Tier network to ensure visibility and access to the broker.\nPython Environment: Make sure Python is installed on your device along with necessary libraries: paho-mqtt, json\nBroker Details: In the script, set the broker_address to the Lenovo server’s IP address and port to 1883 (default MQTT port).\nA client is formed with a ClientID that should be descriptive, we then connect to the MQTT broker A dictionary of values can be converted to JSON format using JSON dump, method. The broker is designed to work with either raw values or JSON The JSON values can be a collection of data types with a Key and Value\nThe publish method publishes the data to the desired stream where other clients can subscribe to the topic.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Subscribing to messages:\n\nA Grafana server has been setup where some useful dashboards can be maintained. The IoT MQTT Panel for Android also offers some nice services including the ability to send messages.\nMore details on subscribing through the Paho-MQTT client can be found at https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/how-to-use-mqtt-in-python ### QoS The protocol allows for fast transmission of messages and a similar PUB/SUB model as ROS topics. Telemetry read data can be sent using QoS level 0 which only attempts a single delivery of the data and does not wait for confirmation of receipt, this is perfectly acceptable for fast streaming data that is not mission critical.\n\nFor mission critical commands such as parameter adjustments and messages to the robot, a QoS level of 2 can be tied to the message which ensures that it is delivered to the robot exactly once. This avoids duplicate commands or lost commands through the network. It is a slower communication protocol but it is not an issue for lower bandwidth messages that are orginating from control devices to the robot.",
