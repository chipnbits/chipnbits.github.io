        "\n",
        "Inverse theory is a set of mathematical techniques used to infer the\n",

        "fundamental tool in many scientific disciplines, including geophysics,\n",
        "seismology, and medical imaging. Inverse theory is used to solve a wide\n",
        "range of problems, such as:\n",

        "\n",
        "What many of these tasks have in common is that we are working with\n",
        "incomplete information. There is a *forward* problem that has generated\n",
        "the data that we observe $\\vec{b}$ from a set of input data $\\vec{x}$,\n",
        "and we want to infer the *inverse* problem that generated the data.\n",
        "However the inverse problem is often ill-posed, meaning that there are\n",
